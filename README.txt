Directions:
The app's user interface is simple and easy to navigate.
1. Upon logging in with the correct credentials, you will be taken to the main page where links to the Customers, Appointments, Reports and the LogOut button are located. The LogOut button will exit you out of the app.
2. The Customers screen is where all the customers are displayed in a table. You can add a new customer by clicking the Add Customer button. You can select a customer by clicking on a table row and you can either edit, delete, or schedule an appointment with a customer by clicking the corresponding buttons while a customer is selected.
3. The Appointments screen is where all the appointments are displayed in a table. You can select an appointment by clicking on a table row and you can either edit or delete it by clicking the corresponding buttons while an appointment is selected. You can also filter the appointments by month and week using the ComboBoxes. Refresh the table to show all appointments in the database.
4. The Reports page has 2 tabs that show different views. The Reports tab contains reports on how many appointments are scheduled per month and per type. There is also a report on how many appointments are scheduled during AM (< 12:00) and PM (> 12:00) hours. The Appointments Schedule tab contains a table of scheduled appointments that can be filtered by contacts using the ComboBox below the table.

The additional report is located in the Reports page in the app. It shows the user how many appointments were scheduled
in AM hours (00:00 - 11:00:00) and PM hours (12:00 - 23:00).
